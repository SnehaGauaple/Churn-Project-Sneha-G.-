#<b>Churning Project</b>

#<b>Business Context.</b>
1) Our goal is to create a model of the problem,. So by using we can make a solutions.

2) Model should be perfect enough to make the solution meaningful, otherwise we will make too many assumptions and approximations, which will make the solutions far from real and meaningless.

#Problem --> Model --> Solutions

3) Creating a machine learning model cannot be an end by itself.

4) The Model should be added value for business create new profits an reduce costs.

5) It's not the end, but we can do so many things with data and also model,So This is our business context

#<b>BUSINESS PROBLEM</b>
1) Business problem is very simple, There is a Bank who wants to retain their existing customers who may churn,

for that they have to know which existing customers has the highest probability of leaving the company

and which customers have lowest probability of leaving the company.

#<b>Solution Developed</b>
1) We have to Clean this data(Data Cleaning).

2) After that, We use Data Preproessing.

3) Then for Visualization we used EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) for better view.

4) Then splitting the data into Training and Testing Data.

5) Using Different Performance Metrics, To know the accuracy.

#<b>Improvements to the Solution</b>
1) So First of all, we read our 'CSV File' that we can know about , How many Features and Label are present.

2) After that ,We seperate all features to know which feature is belong to numerical and categorical feature.

3) Then, We plot the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to Know the data in very clear form by using Visualization.

4) EDA used on particular feature after hat we used 'MinMax Scalar' to Normalize(Scaling) the data.

5) After that, We used Mean, Meadian and Percentile on Numerical Features. To know, How many customers are churn(left)

or not churn(stay).

6) Then we concate the both Numerical and Categorical Feature.

7) We already seperate the data into numerical and categorical data.

8) After that we doing some EDA, Performance Metrics and also Algorithms like,

KNN Algorithm, Logistic Regression, SVM ,Decision Tree, Random Forest To know the accuracy in different forms.

9) So, The final Conclusion of this project is Random Forest gives best accuracy and we can use this method in production.
